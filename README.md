Headgear for walking and stuff...  

Essentially a raspberry pi zero w - powered camera, sensor, and display system for when I go walking - I want it as a piece of headgear.  Some sort of forehead strap/material with hardpoints for mounting everything.

I want a magnetometer/accelerometer for handling direction (compass), display the time, and of course a camera to take photos every few minutes.  This way, I can automatically record snippets of existence and possibly capture things that I might otherwise miss without having to stop and take pictures with my phone.

Yes - the 'mann' portion of the project name is inspiration from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann_(inventor)
